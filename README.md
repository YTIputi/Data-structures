# 📘 Data Structures – Personal Study Repo

Hi! This is my personal repository where I explore and try to understand various **data structures** step by step.
I'm not a professional or a teacher — this project is mainly for **my own learning** and practice.

It includes:

* My own implementations of common data structures
* Notes about how they work
* Time complexity summaries
* Pros and cons (as I understand them)
* A list of related LeetCode problems to get hands-on experience

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder contains:

* 🧠 A basic explanation of the data structure
* ⚙️ Code implementation

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

* To learn and solidify my understanding of data structures
* To have a personal reference I can come back to
* To improve my problem-solving skills by practicing related coding problems

## ⚠️ Note

This is a **learning project**, not a tutorial or a guide.
Everything here is based on my own research, practice, and understanding. Feedback is welcome, but I’m mainly doing this to **get better step by step**.
